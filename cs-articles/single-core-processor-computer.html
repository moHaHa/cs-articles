# Figure 1: Computer Components

# Single-Core Processor Computer:

# We will present a hierarchy of simple computer components and the central processing unit.

# The simple single-core processor computer consists of the following components:

a) Central Processing Unit (CPU):
   - Executes all processing operations in the computer and is often referred to as the processor.

b) Memory:
   - Responsible for storing information.

c) I/O Units:
   - Facilitates the transfer of information between the computer and the surrounding environment.

d) Internal Connection System:
   - Refers to the way computer components are connected to each other, for example, using the system bus that connects the central processing unit, memory, and I/O units.

# The Single-Core Processor Components:

| CPU Core Components                                                                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  - Instruction Processing Unit                                                            |
|    - Responsible for fetching, decoding instructions, and managing memory addresses.      |
|  - Arithmetic Unit                                                                        |
|    - Executes instructions.                                                               |
|  - Load/Store Logic                                                                       |
|    - Manages data transfer between primary memory and secondary memory.                   |
|  - Cache Memory                                                                           |
|    - Divided into two levels: Level 1 (L1) for instructions, Level 2 (L2) for data.       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

# The central processing unit (CPU) is the most crucial component in the computer and consists of:

a) Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU):
   - Responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations.

b) Control Unit:
   - Manages the execution of instructions.

c) Registers:
   - Small, fast storage locations within the CPU.

d) Internal Interconnection:
   - The internal bus connecting the CPU components.
